# Systematic-Discrimination-Checker

The Systematic Discrimination Checker provides tools for analyzing workplace demographic data with a focus on pay equity and bias detection. It allows you to:
- Load or generate employee data
- Analyze correlations between pay and protected characteristics (age, gender, disability, immigrant status, record of offences)
        Check if pay is statistically correlated with characteristics protected by Ontario Human Rights Law
- Analyze specific managers for bias in promotion habits
        Check if promotions are biased based on protected characteristics protected by Ontario Human Rights Law
- Compare your company’s gender distribution, pay, and gender pay gap to Canadian industry standards
        Check how your company's data compares to other national industry benchmarks
